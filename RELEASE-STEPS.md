The following steps must be executed to create a release:

1. Update the release notes
2. Update the version number in the `plugin.xml`
3. Commit and push the version update to GitHub
4. Mare sure you have your AWS access key in your env to allow uploading the documentation.
5. Remove the Onegini NPM registry from your `~/.npmrc` file. We must release to the public NPM repo and not the Onegini repo.
6. Perform NPM login (`npm login`) with your personal onegini `npm` account.
7. Publish the NPM package using the tool `np`. execute `np` to trigger an NPM release. In case you are not releasing from master you need to append `--any-branch` to the np command. [`np` requires you to use Node.js versions 10.0.0 or later]
8. Run `invoke documentation` to upload the documentation to S3. (Don't forget to re-enable the Onegini NPM registry first). [`invoke documentation` does not work with latest versions of Node.js, recommended version - `6.11.0`]
9. Draft a new GitHub release
10. Create a merge request of the release branch to master
11. Update the version number in the `plugin.xml` and `package.json` files for the next development iteration (bump the version and append `-SNAPSHOT`) on the develop branch
