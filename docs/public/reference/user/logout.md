# Logout

<!-- toc -->

For security reasons it is always a good idea to explicitly logout a user. You can use this function to do so.

## `onegini.user.logout`

- Logs out the currently authenticated user.

```js
onegini.user.logout()
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Logout successful");
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log("Something went wrong! " + err.description);
  });
```

The error callback contains an object with the following properties.

| Property | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | 8000 | The error code
| `description` | "Onegini: Internal plugin error." | Human readable error description
